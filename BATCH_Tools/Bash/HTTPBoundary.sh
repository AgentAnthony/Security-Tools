#Description: This script checks a file with URLs to see if they can reached via a curl command.\n
#	      The objective was to test to see if paths to a web server that requires authentication \n
#	      Could be reached from a user who is not authenticated
#	      reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6136022/script-to-get-the-http-status-code-of-a-list-of-urls
