# Installation-04: Alpha Halo
THis is a collection of scripts designed to automate and/or ease the installation of various github tools that I have used in the past. This is mainly for tools I tried running on Kali Linux. Lastly, the Installation-04 is from Halo and all rights are reserved by 343 Industries and Microsoft.
